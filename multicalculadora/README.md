# Multicalculadora (Java)
This is a small console-based calculator program that I developed in 2022 when
I was 17. It was part of a school assignment, but the project was completely
open-ended and we could create whatever we wanted. I decided to design this
"multi-calculator" on my own as a way to practice programming and work on a
menu-based application from scratch. (This project was created for learning and practice purposes.)

## Description
The program works as a multi-function calculator where the user can select
different operations through a text-based menu. Each option performs a
different type of calculation, and the program continues running until the user
chooses to exit.
> Note: The program interface, menu options, and comments are written in Spanish.

I mainly used this project to practice:
- program structure and flow
- user input and menus
- loops and conditionals
- organizing code into methods

## How to Run
Compile and run the main Java file in any standard Java IDE or from the command
line. The program runs in the console and guides the user through the menu
options.
