## Toy Inheritance Project
This is a small Java project where I practice object-oriented programming by
building an inheritance hierarchy for different types of toys.

## Description
The project starts with a base `Toy` class that contains the common fields and
behaviors shared by all toys. Then, several subclasses extend `Toy` and add
their own attributes and behavior to represent more specific toy types.

## Concepts Demonstrated
- inheritance and class hierarchies
- constructors and object creation
- method overriding
- encapsulation and private fields
- polymorphism and shared behavior

## How to Run
Compile and run the main Java file in any standard Java IDE (such as IntelliJ,
Eclipse, or NetBeans) or using the command line Java compiler.
