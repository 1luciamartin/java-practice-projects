## Toy Inheritance Project
This project demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts in Java using an inheritance hierarchy of toy types.
## Description
A base `Toy` class defines common attributes and behaviors shared by all toys. Multiple subclasses extend this base class to represent specific toy types, each with its own characteristics.
## Concepts Demonstrated
- Inheritance
- Method overriding
- Constructors
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Object-oriented programming
## How to Run
Compile and run the main Java file using any standard Java IDE or the command line.
