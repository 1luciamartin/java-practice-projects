# Java Practice Projects
This repository contains a collection of small Java projects and exercises that
I have written for my Computer Science coursework and personal practice. Most
of these projects were done while learning and practicing core programming and
OOP concepts.

## What this repo includes
Some of the projects in this repository include:

- small programming practice exercises
- object-oriented programming projects
- inheritance and class-based design
- console-based applications (such as my multi-calculator project)

I use these projects mainly as a way to practice writing code, organizing
classes, and improving my understanding of Java.

## Topics practiced
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- classes, objects, and methods
- constructors and fields
- control structures and program logic
- basic data structures and problem-solving

## About me
I am a Computer Science student with an interest in software development and
AI-related technologies, and I use projects like these to practice and improve
my programming skills.
